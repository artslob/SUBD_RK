Question: 1
You are not sure if Flashback Database is enabled. What database column and view can you
query to see if the flashback logs are being created in the flash recovery area?
A. Query the initialization parameter FLASHBACK_DATABASE in VJINSTANCE.
B. Query the FLASHBACK_ENABLED column in VJDATABASE.
C. Query the FLASHBACK column in VJDATABASE..
D. Query the FLASHBACK_ON column in VJDATABASE.
Answer: D
Explanation:
To enable Flashback Database, you use the command ALTER DATABASE FLASHBACK ON.
Your database must be in ARCHIVELOG mode, you must have the flash recovery area
configured, and you must have DB_FLASHBACK_RETENTION_TARGET set to an appropriate
value.
A, B, and C are incorrect because they all specify columns that do not exist.
Question: 2
What dynamic performance view can you query to list the supported platforms for transportable
tablespaces?
A. V$TRANSPORTABLE_PLATFORM
B. V$TRANSPORTABLE_TABLESPACE
C. V$SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS
D. V$DATABASE PLATFORM
Answer: A
Explanation:
You use the PLATFORM_NAME and ENDIAN_FORMAT columns to determine the supported
endian formats for all supported platforms. B, C, and D are incorrect because none of these views
exist.
Question: 3
You issue the following command to enable block change tracking: SQL> ALTER DATABASE
ENABLE BLOCK CHANGE TRACKING; However, you receive an error message, and the
tracking file is not created. What is a possible reason for the error message?
A. The parameter DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST is not set.
B. You must use ALTER SYSTEM instead.
C. Your database must be in the MOUNT state to create the block change tracking file.
D. The parameter DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST is not set.
Answer: D
Explanation:
Unless you explicitly specify a location for the block change tracking file using the USING FILE
clause, the file is created using Oracle Managed Files (OMF), which requires a destination in the
parameter DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST.
A is incorrect because DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST specifies the location of the flash recovery
area.
B is incorrect because the tracking file is created at the database level, not the system level.
C is incorrect because you can create the tracking file when the database is OPEN; however, to
rename the tracking file, the database must be in the MOUNT state.
Question: 4
You are restoring and recovering a database to a new host. What data dictionary view will you
use to identify the names of the datafiles on the new database?
A. DBA_DATAFILE
B. VJTABLESPACE
C. VJDATAFILE
D. V$DATAFILE_COPY
E. VJBACKUP DATAFILE
Answer: C
Explanation:
V$DATAFILE lists all the datafiles for the new database, and you will use these names in the SET
NEWNAME command within the RMAN RUN block. A is incorrect because no data dictionary
view called DBA_DATAFILE exists, and even if it did exist, the view would not be available when
the database is in the MOUNT state. B, D, and E arencorrect because these views do not contain
information about datafile names on the new host.
Question: 5
Your flash recovery area becomes full when you are running an RMAN backup (and has not yet
reached the value specified by DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST). It is the destination for archived
redo log files and backups. What will happen to the database? (Choose the best answer.)
A. If you have the flash recovery area set toautoextend, the backup will continue with no problem.
B. The database will hang until you add more space to the flash recovery area.
C. RMAN will delete obsolete backups from the flash recovery area to accommodate new
backups.
D. The RMAN backup will hang until you add more space to the flash recovery area.
Answer: C
Explanation:
RMAN will delete files from the flash recovery area if they are obsolete according to the defined
retention policy.
A is incorrect because you cannot configure the flash recovery area for autoextend .
B is incorrect because the RMAN backup will fail, but the database will continue to run as long as
space is available in the flash recovery area for archived redo log files or it is an optional
destination.
D is incorrect because the RMAN backup will attempt to clean up obsolete files, and failing that, it
will terminate the backup with an error message.
Question: 6
You want to ensure the recoverability of the recovery catalog itself. Which of the following steps
should you implement to maximize recoverability? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Configure the database for ARCHIVELOG mode.
B. Use BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG when you back up the recovery catalog.
C. Put the recovery catalog in the target database, and include a backup of the recovery catalog
with every backup.
D. Use BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG when you back up the recovery catalog.
E. Back up the recovery catalog to disk and tape after each target database backup (in other
words, two separate media types).
Answer: A, B, D, E
Explanation:
These are all best practices for a recovery catalog that also apply to any mission-critical
database. C is incorrect because you should never store the recovery catalog database in the
target database.
Question: 7
For which of the following scenarios would you use user-managed incomplete recovery? (Choose
all that apply.)
A. You have lost a data file and one or more of the archived redo log files are missing.
B. Several widespread logical errors have occurred in the database in the last day.
C. You want to create a test database as of a point in time in the past.
D. You have lost a data file and you have all archived redo log files available.
E. You have lost one of the copies of the control file.
Answer: A, B, C
Explanation:
A is correct because you cannot perform a full recovery with missing archived redo log files.
B is correct because incomplete recovery can be performed to bring the database back to a point
in time before the severe logical corruptions occurred.
C is correct because you can easily copy the database and recover it to a point in time in the past
for regression testing.
D is incorrect because you can perform complete recovery if you have lost a datafile and have all
archived redo log files since the last backup of the datafile . E is incorrect because you do not
need to perform recovery if only one copy of the control file is missing.
Question: 8
You want to leverage resource consumer groups when using the Scheduler. Which Scheduler
object uses resource plans directly?
A. A lightweight job
B. Ajob class
C. Ajob chain
D. A program
Answer: B
Explanation:
You create a job class with CREATE_JOB_CLASS and specify a resource consumer group with
the RESOURCE_CONSUMER_GROUP parameter. You can also specify a resource plan with
CREATE_WINDOW.
A is incorrect because you cannot directly link a lightweight job with a consumer group.
C is incorrect because job chains only specify conditional execution and sequencing among a set
of related jobs.
D is incorrect because you cannot directly associate a program with a resource plan
or resource consumer group
Question: 9
You need to recover the database after a disk is lost but you are missing two archived redo log
files. You need to run the RMAN RECOVER DATABASE UNTIL command. In what database
state can you perform this recovery?
A. OPEN
B. MOUNT
C. RESTRICTED
D. NOMOUNT
Answer: B
Explanation:
You must have the control file open but cannot open the datafiles during recovery.
A is incorrect because the database cannot be open during a full database recovery.
C is incorrect because RESTRICTED mode is the same as OPEN, except restricted to users with
SYSDBA privileges.
D is incorrect because NOMOUNT does not open the control file, and you need to control file
contents to perform recovery.
Question: 10
Which of the following methods can you use to enable duplexed RMAN backups? (Choose two
answers.)
A. Use the initialization parameter RMAN_BACKUP_COPIES.
B. Use the BACKUP COPIES option in the RMAN CONFIGURE command.
C. Use the BACKUP COPIES option in the ALLOCATE CHANNEL command.
D. Use the COPIES option in the RMAN BACKUP command.
Answer: B,D
Explanation:
You configure backup copies either in the CONFIGURE command for the device type or during
the backup itself in the BACKUP command.
A is incorrect because no such initialization parameter controls RMAN backup copies.
C is incorrect because you cannot control the number of backup copies in the ALLOCATE
command.
Question: 11
Which of the following tablespaces can be recovered while the database is online? (Choose all
that apply.)
A. USERS
B. UNDO
C. SYSAUX
D. SYSTEM 3
E. EXAMPLE
Answer: A,C,E
Explanation:
The USERS, SYSAUX, and EXAMPLE tablespaces are not considered critical tablespaces , so
the database can be OPEN when these tablespaces are recovered.
B and D are incorrect because the database will not open without the SYSTEM or UNDO
tablespaces .
Question: 12
Which of the following methods can you use to run a job chain? (Choose all that apply).
A. Create and schedule a job with CREATEJOB of type CHAIN.
B. Create and schedule a chain using the CREATE_CHAIN procedure.
C. Create and schedule a chain using the CREATE_JOB_CHAIN procedure.
D. Use the START_CHAIN procedure.
E. Use the RUN_CHAIN procedure.
Answer: A,E
Explanation:
You can initiate a job chain by creating and scheduling a job with CREATE_JOB of type CHAIN,
or you can use the RUN_CHAIN procedure.
B is incorrect because CREATE_CHAIN creates only the chain container and not any of the
steps; therefore, you cannot run it.
C and D are incorrect because there are no such procedures as CREATE_JOB_CHAIN or
START_CHAIN
Question: 13
Which of the following commands successfully allocates a channel? (Choose all that apply.)
A. ALLOCATE CHANNEL T2 TYPE TAPE;
B. ALLOCATE CHANNEL T2 TYPE SBT;
C. ALLOCATE CHANNEL DB2 TYPE DISK PARMS='SBT_LIBRARY=mmv.so';
D. ALLOCATE CHANNEL T1 TYPE DISK;
Answer: B,D
Explanation:
Only two valid media types exist for ALLOCATE CHANNEL: DISK and TAPE. Each type allows
only certain parameters such as FORMAT and PARMS.
A is incorrect because there is no such type TAPE.
C is incorrect because you cannot specify media manager library settings for a backup to disk.
Question: 14
To enable remote connections to the database using the password file, what values should
REMOTE_LOGIN_PASSWORDFILE have? (Choose all that apply.)
A. NONE
B. SHARED
C. EXCLUSIVE
D. REMOTE
Answer: B,C
Explanation:
The value of REMOTE_LOGIN_PASSWORDFILE can be either SHARED or EXCLUSIVE to
allow both SYS and non-SYS users to connect to the database remotely (instead of using
operating system authentication).
A is incorrect because a value of NONE requires operating system authentication to connect to
the database as a privileged user.
D is incorrect because the value REMOTE is not valid for REMOTE_LOGIN_PASSWORDFILE.
Question: 15
You want to use Flashback Transaction Query to identify the SQL needed to reverse a
transaction in the HR. EMPLOYEES table. Where can you find out the value of the transaction ID
column XID to use when you query FLASHBACK_TRANSACTION_QUERY? (Choose the best
answer.)
A. From the VERSIONS_XID column of HR. EMPLOYEES
B. FromLogMiner
C. From the XID column of HR.EMPLOYEES
D. From the VERSIONS XID column of FLASHBACK VERSION QUERY
Answer: A
Explanation:
Every table has the pseudo-column VERSIONS_XID that you can query for a transaction ID of a
past transaction with the AS OF clause.
B is incorrect because LogMiner only queries the contents of online and archived redo log files
and is much more cumbersome that using an AS OF query.
C is incorrect because XID is not a pseudo-column.
D is incorrect because there is no such column VERSIONS_XID of the table
FLASHBACK_VERSION_QUERY; you need to have the XID or SCN before querying
FLASHBACK_VERSION_QUERY and retrieve the SQL to reverse the transaction.
Question: 16
Setting which of the following initialization parameters enables Automatic Memory Management?
A. MEMORYJARGET
B. MEMORY_MAX_TARGET
C. SGATARGET
D. PGA AGGREGATE TARGET
Answer: A
Explanation:
When you set MEMORY_TARGET, the SGA and PGA memory areas will be dynamically tuned
as a whole, although you can specify minimum values for the SGA with SGA_TARGET and for
the PGA with PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET.
B is incorrect because MEMORY_MAX_TARGET specifies a maximum value for
MEMORY_TARGET but does not trigger AMM.
C is incorrect because SGA_TARGET sets only a minimum value for the SGA when AMM is
enabled and specifies autotuning of the SGA when MEMORY_TARGET is set to zero or not
set.
D is incorrect because PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET sets a minimum value for the PGA only
when AMM is enabled.
Question: 17
You configure AUTOBACKUP to ON in an RMAN session. When will RMAN back up the control
file? (Choose all that apply.)
A. When you run an RMAN BACKUP command
B. When you run an RMAN ALLOCATE command
C. When you add or drop a table in the SYSTEMtablespace
D. When you change the physical structure of the database, such as dropping atablespace
E. When you specify the INCLUDING CONTROLFILE clause
Answer: A
Explanation:
EXPLANATION:
When you set MEMORY_TARGET, the SGA and PGA memory areas will be dynamically tuned
as a whole, although you can specify minimum values for the SGA with SGA_TARGET and for
the PGA with PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET.
B is incorrect because MEMORY_MAX_TARGET specifies a maximum value for
MEMORY_TARGET but does not trigger AMM.
C is incorrect because SGA_TARGET sets only a minimum value for the SGA when AMM is
enabled and specifies autotuning of the SGA when MEMORY_TARGET is set to zero or not
set.
D is incorrect because PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET sets a minimum value for the PGA only
when AMM is enabled.
Question: 18
Which of the following two parameters must you specify to use a flash recovery area for all of
your backups? (Choose two answers.)
A. DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST_SIZE
B. DB_RECYCLE_CACHE_SIZE
C. DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST
D. DB RECOVERY FILE SIZE
Answer: A,C
Explanation:
DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST_SIZE specifies the maximum space used by the recovery-related
files, even if more or less space is available at the destination. DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST
specifies the location for all recovery-related files.
B is incorrect because DB_RECYCLE_CACHE_SIZE does not control any aspect of the flash
recovery area.
D is incorrect because there is no such parameter as DB_RECOVERY_FILE_SIZE.
Question: 19
Your database is not using an RMAN recovery catalog. Which of the following commands are not
available to you in this scenario? (Choose all that apply.)
A. CONFIGURE RETENTION . . .
B. BACKUP . . .KEEP FOREVER
C. DELETE . . . EXPIRED
D. REPORT SCHEMA ... AT
Answer: B,D
Explanation:
B and D are correct. If you are using the control file only for RMAN backups, backup information
may age out of the control file and therefore will not be kept forever. In addition, schema changes
are stored only in a recovery catalog but not in the control file.
A is incorrect because you can configure RMAN parameters whether or not a recovery catalog is
configured.
C is incorrect because you can always delete backups that are older or outside the defined
retention policy.
Question: 20
Which of the following dynamic performance views can you use to show the total CPU time for a
consumer group? (Choose the best answer.)
A. V$RSRC_CONSUMER_GROUP
B. V$SESSTAT
C. V$SYSSTAT
D. V$RSRC CONSUMER GRP
Answer: A
Explanation:
The column CONSUMED_CPU_TIME shows the total CPU used for the consumer group, by all
sessions in the consumer group.
B is incorrect because V$SESSTAT shows the CPU time only at the session level.
C is incorrect because V$SYSSTAT shows the cumulative CPU time for all sessions.
D is incorrect because the dynamic performance view V$RSRC_CONSUMER_GRP does not
exist.
Question: 21
You want to designate one of the Linux system administrators as the recovery catalog owner.
Which role must you grant to her Oracle user account?
A. RECOVERY_CATALOG
B. CATALOGjDWNER
C. RECOVERY_CATALOG_OWNER
D. SYSDBA
Answer: C
Explanation:
The predefined role RECOVERY_CATALOG_OWNER includes the system privileges ALTER
SESSION, CREATE CLUSTER, CREATE DATABASE LINK, CREATE PROCEDURE, CREATE
SEQUENCE, CREATE SESSION, CREATE SYNONYM, CREATE TABLE, CREATE TRIGGER,
CREATE TYPE, and CREATE VIEW.
A, B are wrong because the RECOVERY_CATALOG and CATALOG_OWNER roles do not exist.
D is wrong because it provides the recovery catalog owner with more system privileges than
necessary.
Question: 22
Fill in the blanks to make the following statement true: You use the________ command so that
the view_______ contains the specified name associated with the session in the
_________column.
A. ALTER SESSION ENABLE RESUMABLE TIMEOUT . . . NAME 'statement description',
DBA_RESUMABLE_STATEMENT, NAME
B. ALTER SESSION ENABLE RESUMABLE TIMEOUT . . . NAME 'statement description',
DBA_RESUMABLE, NAME
C. ALTER SESSION ENABLE RESUMABLE TIMEOUT . . . NAME 'statement description',
DBA_RESUMABLE, SQL_NAME
D. ALTER USER ENABLE RESUMABLE TIMEOUT . . . NAME 'statement description',
DBA_RESUMABLE, NAME
Answer: B
Explanation:
You use the NAME parameter in ALTER SESSION to create a description of the SQL to make it
easier for the DBA to identify a resumable statement when it runs out of space.
A is incorrect because there is no such view as DBA_RESUMABLE_STATEMENT.
C is incorrect because there is no such column as SQL_NAME in DBA_RESUMABLE.
D is incorrect because you use ALTER SESSION and not ALTER USER to set the name of the
statement that may trigger resumable space allocation.
Question: 23
You execute this command: CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY CLEAR; What is the retention
policy set to after running the command?
A. Retention is set to the default of REDUNDANCY 1.
B. No retention policy will be defined.
C. Retention will be set according to the value of the initialization parameter
CONTROL_FILE_RECORD_KEEP_TIME.
D. Retention is set to RECOVERY WINDOW OF 4 DAYS.
E. Retention is set to the default of REDUNDANCY 2.
Answer: A
Explanation:
By default, RMAN keeps one full copy of the database.
B is incorrect because a retention policy is defined.
C is incorrect because there is no relationship between the RMAN records in the control file and
the retention policy.
D and E are incorrect because they are not the default values for the RMAN retention policy.
Question: 24
You lose an entire redo log group that is in the CURRENT state. What happens to the database
instance and how can you recover from the lost redo log group?
A. The instance will hang until you clear the redo log group.
B. The instance will shut down or crash and you can perform complete recovery using the
archived redo log files.
C. The instance will skip to the next redo log group.
D. The instance will shut down or crash and you will have to perform cancel-based recovery.
Answer: D
Explanation:
The instance will shut down or crash when the current redo log file group is lost and you will have
to perform cancel-based recovery because the lost redo log group contained committed
transactions.
A is incorrect because the instance will shut down or crash, and you cannot clear a redo log
group that is missing.
B is incorrect because you cannot perform complete recovery with a missing redo
log file group in the CURRENT state.
C is incorrect because Oracle cannot skip a redo log file group.
Question: 25
Identify the correct relationships between resource consumer groups, resource plan directives,
and resource plans. (Choose all that apply.)
A. Only one resource plan can be active at a time.
B. A user can be a member of only one resource consumer group.
C. One resource plan can have multiple plan directives.
D. A user can be assigned to more than one resource plan.
Answer: A,C
Explanation:
Only one resource plan is in effect at any given time. In addition, a resource plan can use a
hierarchical method to allocate resources at different percentages depending on priority.
B is incorrect because a user can be a member of multiple consumer groups.
D is incorrect because you cannot assign users directly to resource plans, only to consumer
groups.
Question: 26
You are using the RMAN Data Recovery Advisor functionality. When an error occurs, which of the
following commands can you use to monitor and maintain failures? (Choose all that apply.)
A. IDENTIFY FAILURE
B. REPAIR FAILURE
C. CHANGE FAILURE
D. ADVISE FAILURE
E. RESET FAILURE
Answer: B,C,D
Explanation:
In addition to REPAIR, CHANGE, and ADVISE FAILURE, you can use the LIST FAILURE
command to see if any unresolved failures exist.
A and E are incorrect because the commands IDENTIFY FAILURE and RESET FAILURE do not
exist.
Question: 27
You are using TISPITR to recover one or more tablespaces to a previous time in point or back to
a specific SCN. What included in the recovery set? (Choose all that apply.)
A. A copy of the SYSTEMtablespace
B. A copy of the SYSAUXtablespace
C. A copy of the UNDOtablespace
D. A temporarytablespace for exported database objects from the auxiliary instance.
E. Thedatafiles from the tablespaces to be recovered
Answer: E
Explanation:
The recovery set includes only the datafiles from the tablespaces to be recovered.
A, B, C, and D are incorrect. None of these objects is included in the recovery set; instead, all of
them are included except for the UNDO tablespace .
Question: 28
You are using a recovery catalog and you lose all copies of your control file. Which of the
following sets commands will you use to restore the control file before you recover the database?
A. SET DBID 188390190; RESTORE CONTROLFILE;
B. SET DBID 188390190; RESTORE CONTROLFILE FROM AUTOBACKUP;
C. RESTORE CONTROLFILE FROM AUTOBACKUP;
D. RESTORE CONTROLFILE;
Answer: D
Explanation:
If you are using a recovery catalog, you do not need to set the DBID or specify AUTOBACKUP.
A is incorrect because you do not need to specify the DBID when you restore the control file
using a recovery catalog.
B is incorrect because you do not need to specify the DBID or AUTOBACKUP when you use a
recovery catalog.
C is incorrect because although this command will work, you do not need to specify
AUTOBACKUP when you use a recovery catalog.
Question: 29
Identify the advantage of recovery an image copy of a datafile during RMAN backup. (Choose all
that apply.)
A. During media recovery, fewer incremental updates need to be applied to the last image copy.
B. The overhead for the block change tracking file is minimal.
C. You do not need to perform additional image copy backups.
D. You no longer need to duplex your backups.
E. The time required to perform the backup and incremental updates to the image copy is
reduced.
Answer: A,C
Explanation:
During media recovery, RMAN can start with the incrementally updated image copy and
potentially apply fewer archived redo log files, significantly reducing recovery time. With an
incrementally updated image copy, any subsequent image copy will be identical to the
incrementally updated image copy.
B is incorrect because a block change tracking file reduces the time it takes RMAN to identify
changed blocks.
D is incorrect because duplexed backups is still a valid backup method to increase the number of
backup copies. E is incorrect because the incremental update will add a slight amount of
overhead during the backup but can dramatically reduce the recovery time.
Question: 30
After you unregister a database from a recovery catalog, what happens to the backup metadata
in the recovery catalog?
A. You mustmigrate the backup metadata from the recovery catalog to the control file before
unregistering the database from the recovery catalog.
B. The backup metadata is maintained in the control file for a number of days specified by the
initialization parameter CONTROL_FILE_RECORD_KEEP_TIME and immediately removed
from the recovery catalog.
C. The backup metadata is retained in the control file, and the database structure metadata
remains in the recovery catalog.
D. The backup metadata is maintained in the control file and in the recovery catalog for a number
of days specified by the initialization parameter CONTROL FILE RECORD KEEP TIME.
Answer: B
Explanation:
The backup metadata is always maintained in the control file for a number of days specified by
the initialization parameter CONTROL_FILE_RECORD_KEEP_TIME.
A is incorrect because the control file always maintains the backup metadata and no migration is
required.
C is incorrect because all metadata for a database is removed from the recovery catalog
when it is unregistered. D is incorrect because a database's metadata is removed immediately
from the recovery catalog when it is unregistered.
Question: 31
You switch from Automatic Memory Management (AMM) to Automatic Shared Memory
Management (ASMM) by executing this statement: alter system set memory_target = 0;
Next, you restart the instance and set these values: alter system set sga_max_size = 10gb;
alter system set sga_target = 8gb; alter system set shared_pool_size = 1 gb; How do the values
of SGA_TARGET, SGA_MAX_SIZE, and SHARED_POOL_SIZE vary throughout the day?
(Choose the best answer.)
A. SGA_TARGET varies up to SGA_MAX_SIZE, which depends on the number of users running
DML
B. SGA_TARGET can fall below 8GB if the PGA is low on memory.
C. SGA_TARGET stays at 8GB, and SHARED_POOL_SIZE never is above 1GB.
D. SGA_TARGET stays at 8GB, and SHARED_POOL_SIZE never falls below 1GB.
Answer: D
Explanation:
When you enable ASMM by setting SGA_TARGET, the value does not change automatically and
the SHARED_POOL_SIZE can grow and shrink as long as it does not fall below 1GB.
A is incorrect because SGA_TARGET will not change dynamically; however, it can be changed
by the DBA as long as it is less than the value of SGA_MAX_SIZE.
B is incorrect because the value of SGA_TARGET does not change and has no effect on the
PGA memory size since AMM is not enabled.
C is incorrect because the value of SHARED_POOL_SIZE can vary above 1GB but is
never lower than 1GB.
Question: 32
Which two dynamic performance views can you use to identify files that need to be backed up,
regardless of whether you are in ARCHIVELOG mode or NOARCHIVELOG mode?
A. V$DATAFILE and VJLOGFILE
B. V$DATAFILE and VJTEMPFILE
C. V$LOG and VJLOGFILE
D. V$DATAFILE and VJCONTROLFILE
Answer: D
Explanation:
The view V$DATAFILE contains all datafiles and V$CONTROLFILE contains a list of all copies of
the control file.
A is wrong because you do not need to back up the online redo log files.
B is wrong because you do not need to back up datafiles from temporary tablespaces , which do
not contain any permanent objects, and can be easily re-created if lost.
C is wrong because online redo log files do not need to be backed up and V$LOG contains
information about online redo log file groups, not individual files.
Question: 33
You want to create an archival backup for historical purposes. Where can you store the archival
backup?
A. To a disk location outside of the recovery area or a tape group
B. To a disk device or the flash recovery area
C. In the flash recovery area only
D. To a tape device or the flash recovery area
E. On any combination of disk and tape devices
Answer: A
Explanation:
An archival backup can be stored only on a disk device outside of the flash recovery area or to a
tape group.
B is incorrect because you cannot save an archival backup to the flash recovery area.
C is incorrect because you can save archival backups to tape or disk but not to the flash recovery
area.
D is incorrect because you cannot save archival backups to the flash recovery area.
E is incorrect because archival backups must reside on a single device type.
Question: 34
You lose all of the datafiles in your TEMP tablespace after the database shuts down. When the
database starts again, what happens?
A. The database instance will not start and you must re-create the TEMPtablespace in MOUNT
mode.
B. The database instance will not start and you will have to drop the old TEMPtablespace in
NOMOUNT mode.
C. Thetempfile is re-created at the original location, a message is written to the alert log, and the
database starts normally.
D. The database starts normally, a message is written to the alert log, and the DBA must
manually re-create the TEMPtablespace.
Answer: C
Explanation:
If the database starts with a missing tempfile , the instance re-creates it and writes a message in
the alert log. If the original location is not available, the DBA will have to create a new one
manually after startup.
A and B are incorrect because the database will start even if the tempfile location is not available.
D is incorrect because the DBA does not need to re-create the tempfile (s) manually unless the
original file system location is unavailable.
Question: 35
Which of the following segment types can you shrink using Oracle's segment shrink functionality?
(Choose all that apply.)
A. Undo segments
B. Index segments
C. Temporary segments
D. Data segments
Answer: B,D
Explanation:
You can shrink data segments and index segments separately.
A and C are incorrect. You cannot shrink undo or temporary segments. They are managed
internally and do not need to be shrunk, because all space in an undo or temporary segment is
released after being used; thus, no free space exists to compact.
Question: 36
You are creating a duplicate (auxiliary) database for testing purposes. Which of the following
initialization parameter files can you use on the auxiliary database to specify the filenames on the
new database? (Choose all that apply.)
A. CONTROL_FILE_NAME_CONVERT
B. LOG_FILE_NAME_CONVERT
C. DB_FILE_NAME_CONVERT
D. DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST
E. CONTROL_FILES
Answer: B,C,E
Explanation:
When you create an auxiliary database, your control files, datafiles , and online log files will most
likely not be in the same location as the source database. Thus, you can use CONTROL_FILES,
DB_FILE_NAME_CONVERT, and LOG_FILE_NAME_CONVERT to specify the new locations.
A is incorrect because the parameter CONTROL_FILE_NAME_CONVERT does not exist.
D is incorrect because DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST is the location Oracle uses to create database
objects when you are using Oracle Managed Files (OMF).
Question: 37
Which of the following DML operations use a significant portion of the PGA? (Choose all that
apply.)
A. Hash joins
B. Buffers for bulk load operations
C. Full table scans
D. Bitmap merges
E. Bitmap create
Answer: A,B,D,E
Explanation:
In addition to hash joins, bulk load operations, bitmap merge, and bitmap create operations, the
PGA is used for sorting operations triggered by ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and ROLLUP, any of
which are used in a SELECT statement.
C is incorrect because full table scans use an insignificant amount of memory in the PGA but a
significant amount of memory in the SGA buffer cache.
Question: 38
You are using RMAN to perform a fast switch to image copies for recovery purposes. You need to
perform a SET NEWNAME command as part of the fast switch. What is the primary restriction
when using SET NEWNAME? (Choose the best answer.)
A. The SET NEWNAME is available only within a RUN block.
B. The SET NEWNAME is available only as a standalone RMAN command.
C. You can use SET NEWNAME only for non-SYSTEMdatafiles.
D. The SET NEWNAME can change only the filename itself and not the directory path.
Answer: A
Explanation:
You use SET NEWNAME in a RUN block to identify the target location for the recovered image
copy when you run the RESTORE command.
B is incorrect because SET NEWNAME is available only within a RUN block.
C is incorrect because you can use SET NEWNAME for any datafile .
D is incorrect because SET NEWNAME specifies the entire pathname and filename for the
restored image file.
Question: 39
Which of the following statements is true regarding lightweight jobs? (Choose all that apply).
A. You can use EM to create a lightweight job.
B. A lightweight job generates minimum redo when it runs.
C. A lightweight job is stored in the same table as other jobs.
D. You use the CREATE_LIGHTWEIGHT_JOB procedure to create a lightweight job.
Answer: B
Explanation:
In addition to generating minimal redo, a lightweight job must also use an existing template to
create it.
A is incorrect because EM cannot specify a JOB_STYLE of LIGHTWEIGHT.
C is incorrect because lightweight jobs are not database objects that need to be created or
dropped.
D is incorrect because there is no such procedure as CREATE_LIGHTWEIGHT_JOB. Instead,
you use CREATE_JOB with A JOB_STYLE of LIGHTWEIGHT.
Question: 40
As the DBA, you run this command on the recovery catalog database: SQL> GRANT
RECOVERY_CATALOG_OWNER TO KMSHELT; what privileges do the user KMSHELT have?
A. KMSHELT can create users that own virtual private catalogs.
B. KMSHELT can immediately use an existing virtual catalog on the recovery catalog database.
C. KMSHELT can register a new database in her Virtual Private Catalog (VPC).
D. KMSHELT can potentially own a VPC but will not be able to unless the DBA grants other
privileges first.
Answer: D
Explanation:
The DBA of the recovery catalog database must either grant the RMAN REGISTER DATABASE
privilege or grant the RMAN CATALOG FOR DATABASE privilege on an existing database
before KMSHELT can use the VPC.
A is incorrect because KMSHELT has only the privilege either to register a database or use an
existing registered catalog.
B is incorrect because the DBA has to grant additional privileges to KMSHELT.
C is incorrect because she needs the RMAN REGISTER DATABASE privilege first.
Question: 41
You drop the table ORDERJTEM, and because you have the RECYCLEBIN initialization
parameter set to ON, the table and its indexes are moved to the recycle bin. Which of the
following are valid names for these two objects in the recycle bin?
A. BINJORDERJTEMJO BIN$ORDERJTEM_PK! I; 0
B. BIN$QR9ZZ=49X2Z$0BIN$QR8ZZ=W9X2Z$0
C. BIN$ORDER_ITEM$0BIN$ORDERJTEM$1
D. BIN$QR9ZZ=49X2Z$0BIN!i;C!R9ZZ=49X2Z!i;i
Answer: B
Explanation:
Every item in the recycle bin contains up to a 26-character identifier that is unique across the
database.
A and C are incorrect because the recycle bin name does not use the original object name.
D is incorrect because the value between the two $ symbols must be unique. The value after the
second $ is an Oracle-assigned version number.
Question: 42
You create and execute a stored local script using the following commands: create script user
backup
{
backup as copy tablespace users; delete noprompt obsolete;
}
execute script user_backup; What happens when you run these commands?
A. The script does not run because it must be executed within a RUN block.
B. An image copy of the USERStablespace occurs and all previous backups and archived redo
logs outside of the retention period or retention policy are deleted.
C. The script creation step fails because you must explicitly allocate one or more channels with a
stored script.
D. The script does not run because you must specify a target database when you use a local
script.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Stored scripts, whether they are local or global, must be run within a RUN block as follows: run
{execute script user_ backup ; }.
B is wrong because a script must be enclosed in a RUN block.
C is wrong because you can include a channel allocation or use the default channel in the RUN
command containing the EXECUTE SCRIPT command.
D is wrong because both local and global scripts apply only to the currently connected target
database.
Question: 43
Which of the following can be a performance bottleneck in RMAN? (Choose all that apply.
A. Reading data
B. Writing data
C. Allocating channels
D. Validating blocks
E. Copying blocks
F. Multiplexing backups
Answer: A,B,D,E
Explanation:
All of these operations can potentially be the slowest operation of the backup.
C is incorrect because channel allocation happens once during a backup and is therefore not a
bottleneck. F is wrong because multiplexing backups will likely reduce the impact of a
bottleneck.
Question: 44
Which of the following cannot be used as input to the SQL Tuning Advisor? (Choose all that
apply.)
A. A single SQL statement provided by a user
B. An existing SQL Tuning Set (STS)
C. A preprocessed Database Replay workload
D. A schema name
E. SQL statement identified in EM as using excessive resources
Answer: C,D
Explanation:
You cannot use Database Replay workloads or an entire schema name as input to the SQL
Tuning Advisor. However, you can specify single SQL statements.
A, B, and E are incorrect because single SQL statements and SQL Tuning Sets can be provided
as input to the SQL Tuning Advisor.
Question: 45
You run the following query against the dynamic performance view V$ASM_DISKGROUP: SQL>
select group_number, name, type, total_mb, free_mb 2 from v$asm diskgroup;
GROUP_NUMBER NAME TYPE TOTAL MB FREE MB
1 DATA NORMAL 24568 20798
2 RECOV NORMAL 24568 24090
3 DATA2 HIGH 16376 16221
What can you infer about the disk group DATA2?
A. Disk group DATA2 is mirrored at the operating system level or with a RAID array.
B. The TYPE column specifies disk group performance, not the redundancy level.
C. Disk group DATA2 is mirrored threefold or more.
D. Disk group DATA2 is mirrored with two disks in the failure group.
Answer: C
Explanation:
If the TYPE column is HIGH, then the disk group is mirrored with at least three disks.
A is incorrect because if the disk group was mirrored at the operating system level or not at all,
the TYPE column would have a value of EXTERN.
B is incorrect because TYPE reflects the redundancy level, not performance level.
D is incorrect because a value of NORMAL in the TYPE column indicates a redundancy level of
two.
Question: 46
Identify the statement that is true about Flashback Data Archive. (Choose the best answer.)
A. You can use multipletablespaces for an archive, and each archive can have its own retention
time.
B. You can have one archive, and for eachtablespace that is part of the archive you can specify a
different retention period.
C. You can use multipletablespaces for an archive, and you can have more than one default
archive per retention period.
D. If you specify a default archive, it must exist in only onetablespace.
Answer: B
Explanation:
A Flashback Data Archive can span multiple tablespaces , each archive can have its own
retention period, and you can specify one and only one default archive for CREATE TABLE or
ALTER TABLE . . . FLASHBACK ARCHIVE commands.
A, C, and D are incorrect. These combinations of Flashback Archive Conditions are incorrect.
Question: 47
How many copies of the alert log are stored in the directory specified by the initialization
parameter DIAGNOSTIC_DEST?
A. One per database
B. One per instance
C. Two per database
D. Two per instance
E. One per incident directory
Answer: D
Explanation:
The alert log is stored in XML format in the alert subdirectory and in text format in the trace
subdirectory. The alert log as well as all other diagnostic information is maintained per instance
(for each instance).
A is incorrect because an alert log exists for each database instance, which is the case in a RAC
environment.
B is incorrect because the alert log is stored in both XML and text formats.
C is incorrect because two copies of the alert log exist per instance, not per database. E is
incorrect because the alert log is not stored in an incident directory.
Question: 48
You lose all control file copies and your datafiles are intact, but your online log files are
unavailable. How do you recover the database in this situation?
A. Re-create the control file and open the database with RESETLOGS.
B. Restore a backup copy of the control file, perform incomplete recovery, and manually specify
the names of the online redo log files. Also, open the database with RESETLOGS.
C. Restore a backup copy of the control file, perform complete recovery, and open the database
with RESETLOGS.
D. Restore a backup copy of the control file, perform incomplete recovery, and open the database
with RESETLOGS.
Answer: A
Explanation:
You will lose some committed transactions because the online logs are not available.
B is incorrect because this solution applies only if both the online logs are available and the
datafiles are current.
C is incorrect because this scenario applies only if the online logs are available but the datafiles
are not current.
D is incorrect because this scenario applies only if the online logs are unavailable and the
datafiles are not current.
Question: 49
You need to determine the proper target time for TSPITR. What methods can you use to
determine the correct target time? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Flashback Database
B. Flashback Version Query
C. Flashback Transaction Query
D. Flashback Query
E. Flashback Drop
F. Flashback Data Archive
Answer: B,C,D
Explanation:
You can use Flashback Version Query, Flashback Transaction Query, or Flashback Query to look
at the data or DML as of a point in time from the past with which to identify the correct SCN or
timestamp for tablespace recovery.
A is incorrect because Flashback Database brings the entire database back to a point in time in
the past. E is wrong because Flashback Drop retrieves dropped tables from the recycle bin. F is
wrong because Flashback Data Archive stores change history for one or more tables, much as
the UNDO tablespace maintains change history for the entire database.
Question: 50
When you perform a whole database backup with the command BACKUP DATABASE PLUS
ARCHIVELOG, which database objects are included in the backup? (Choose the best answer.)
A. Alldatafiles and archived log files. The control file is included if you add the CONTROLFILE
keyword, and the SPFILE is included if your configuration includes automatic backup of the
SPFILE.
B. Alldatafiles and archived log files. The SPFILE is included if you add the SPFILE keyword, and
the control file is included if your configuration includes automatic backup of the control file.
C. Alldatafiles and archived log files; after the operation successfully completes, the archived log
files are automatically deleted.
D. Alldatafiles and archived log files only, regardless of the current RMAN settings.
Answer: B
Explanation:
The command backs up all datafiles plus the archived log files. It backs up the SPFILE if you
include the SPFILE keyword, and it backs up the control file if autobackup of the control file is
configured.
A is incorrect because no such CONTROLFILE keyword exists, and you cannot specify
autobackup of the SPFILE alone.
C is incorrect because archived log files are deleted only if you include the DELETE INPUT
option.
D is incorrect because configured RMAN settings specify other files included in the backup.
Question: 51
You want to perform some maintenance on your ASM disk groups. As a result, you want to
prevent RDBMS instances from connecting to the ASM instance, but you do not want to shut
down the ASM instance. What command will achieve this objective?
A. ALTER SYSTEM ENABLE RESTRICTED SESSION
B. ALTER SYSTEM SUSPEND
C. ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION
D. ALTER SYSTEM SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE
Answer: A
Explanation:
Running ALTER SYSTEM ENABLE RESTRICTED SESSION prevents connections from RDBMS
instances.
B is incorrect because SUSPEND is valid only for an RDBMS instance.
C is incorrect because KILL SESSION will disconnect a user's session, but it will not prevent new
connections.
D is incorrect because this command is not syntactically correct.
Question: 52
You can use the EM Support Workbench for which of the following tasks? (Choose all correct
answers.)
A. Run recommended repairs.
B. Manually run a health check.
C. Close problems and incidents.
D. Generate additional SQL test cases to help Oracle Support solve the problem.
E. View problems and incidents.
Answer: B,C,D,E
Explanation:
B, C, D, and E are correct. You can use the Support Workbench for viewing problems and
incidents, manually running health checks, generating additional dumps and test cases for Oracle
Support, creating and tracking a service request to Oracle Support, collecting all data related to a
problem and packaging it, and closing the problem when it has been resolved.
A is incorrect because the EM Support Workbench cannot run recommended repairs. However,
you can initiate advisors that can recommend repairs.
Question: 53
You have a very large table that your users access frequently. Which of the following advisors will
recommend any indexes to improve the performance of queries against this table?
A. The Automatic Memory Manager (AMM)
B. The SQL Tuning Advisor
C. The Segment Advisor
D. The SQL Access Advisor
Answer: D
Explanation:
The SQL Access Advisor analyzes all SQL running during a given time period and recommends
indexes and materialized views to improve the overall performance of the database.
A is incorrect because there is no such advisor as the Automatic Memory Manager.
B is incorrect because the SQL Tuning Advisor looks only at a single SQL statement and
provides recommendations.
C is incorrect because the Segment Advisor recommends segment shrink when table and index
segments are heavily fragmented.
Question: 54
Which of the following are valid reasons for using a duplicate database? (Choose all that apply.)
A. You want to test a new application's performance with no impact to the production database.
B. You want to perform Flashback Table on a group of tables without impacting user transactions.
C. You want to test an upgrade from Oracle Database 11 g R1 to Oracle Database 11 g R2.
D. You want to test backup and recovery procedures.
Answer: A,C,D
Explanation:
They are all valid reasons to use a duplicate database.
B is incorrect because you can perform Flashback Table on the source database with minimal
impact to user transactions.
Question: 55
Your CUSTOMER_ORDER and ORDERJTEMS table is updated daily with both phone orders
and Internet orders. During an ad-hoc maintenance operation, an operations specialist
accidentally deletes several items from an order placed last week. Which flashback feature will
minimize the loss of recent updates to the ORDERJTEMS table and easily retrieve the missing
rows? (Choose the best answer.)
A. Flashback Data Archive
B. Flashback Version Query
C. Flashback Query
D. Flashback Transaction Query
E. Flashback Table
Answer: C
Explanation:
You can use INSERT INTO . . . SELECT . . . AS OF to retrieve the lost rows, specifying a
timestamp value right before the accidental deletion.
A is incorrect because Flashback Data Archive makes it easier to retain historical data but does
not directly retrieve the missing rows.
B is incorrect because even though Flashback Versions Query makes it easy to see versions of a
row within a specific time period, you will have to perform additional steps to insert the missing
data.
D is incorrect because you can access all the changes made for a given transaction, but you
need to know the transaction ID and still have to insert the missing rows. E is incorrect
because even though Flashback Table will rewind the table to a point in time before the rows
were deleted, you will lose all recent transactions to the table.
Question: 56
You define your national character set as AL16UTF16. What datatypes will store Unicode data?
(Choose all that apply.)
A. NVARCHAR2
B. XMLTYPE
C. NCLOB
D. NBLOB
E. LONG I
F. NCHAR
Answer: A,C,F
Explanation:
When the database's national character set is defined as UTF8 or AL16UTF16, you can store
Unicode data in NVARCHAR2, NCLOB, and NCHAR datatypes .
B is incorrect because the database character set applies to XMLTYPE data and not the national
character set.
D is incorrect because there is no such datatype as NBLOB. E is incorrect because
LONG datatypes do not store Unicode data and they are supported only for backward
compatibility using the database character set.
Question: 57
Which of the following archived log file configurations is the most ideal configuration per Oracle's
recommendation?
A. Use a flash recovery area mirrored on an external RAID system only.
B. Archive to the flash recovery area and one location outside of the flash recovery area.
C. Set two archived log destinations to non-flash recovery areas.
D. Use a flash recovery area mirrored on an ASM disk group only.
Answer: D
Explanation:
The highest performance and ease of maintenance configuration is a single destination to a flash
recovery area stored in a mirrored ASM disk group.
A, B, and C are viable options but do not maximize performance, ease of maintenance, and
recoverability.
Question: 58
Which of the following database objects are not candidates for RMAN image copies? (Choose all
that apply.)
A. Datafiles
B. Online redo log files
C. Flashback log files
D. Archived redo log files
E. Password files
Answer: B,C,E
Explanation:
B, C, and E cannot be backed up as image copies. You should never back up online redo log files
under any circumstances, you do not need to back up flashback logs, and password files cannot
be backed up by RMAN.
A is incorrect because any datafile can be backed up as an RMAN image copy. D is incorrect
because you can back up archived redo log files as image copies.
Question: 59
You inadvertently delete some RMAN backups with operating system commands. You perform
additional backups from RMAN again but you need to remove the deleted backups from the
recovery catalog. What commands can you use to clean up the catalog? (Choose all that apply.)
A. DELETE EXPIRED
B. CROSSCHECK
C. DELETE OBSOLETE
D. UNCATALOG
E. DELETE UNAVAILABLE
Answer: B,D
Explanation:
The CROSSCHECK command compares the backups in the catalog to the actual backups on
disk, and the UNCATALOG command unconditionally removes a backup from the recovery
catalog.
A is incorrect because DELETE EXPIRED removes only entries from the recovery catalog whose
status is EXPIRED.
C is incorrect because DELETE OBSOLETE deletes only backups that are no longer needed to
satisfy the retention policy. E is incorrect because the command DELETE UNAVAILABLE does
not exist.
Question: 60
You frequently have multiple RMAN sessions running, and you want to be able to easily identify
each job via the CLIENTJNFO column of the dynamic performance view VJSESSION. What
RMAN command can you run to set the value for this column?
A. setclientjnfo to 'RJB rman session';
B. set command id to 'RJBrman session';
C. setchanneljd to 'RJB rman session';
D. setsession_name to 'RJB rman session
Answer: C
Explanation:
The value you specify for CHANNEL ID is concatenated with the value for CLIENT_INFO in
V$SESSION.
A, B, and D are incorrect because these commands are syntactically incorrect
Question: 61
Which of the following statements are true regarding ASM instances and disks? (Choose all that
apply.)
A. The RBAL background process exists only on the ASM instance.
B. You can use ASM disks with RAID disk systems.
C. An ASM instance has its own data dictionary.
D. ASM instances must be in the OPEN state to manage disk groups.
E You can mix ASM disk groups with raw disks.
Answer: B
Explanation:
If you use ASM with RAID disk systems, you will typically turn off the ASM disk group redundancy
and let the RAID system handle it; however, using ASM to manage mirroring and load balancing
is typically more efficient. In addition, you can mix ASM disk groups with raw disks and datafiles
on a file system.
A is incorrect because RBAL exists on both the ASM instance and the RDBMS instance.
C is incorrect because an ASM disk does not have a database and thus no data dictionary.
D is incorrect because ASM instances can only be in the NOMOUNT or MOUNT state.
Question: 62
You are querying V$BACKUP_ASYNC_IO to determine which files are the bottleneck during
RMAN backups. What columns should you use to identify bottlenecks? (Choose the best
answer.)
A. Divide IO_COUNT by LONG_WAITS and look for a large number.
B. LONG_WAIT_TIME_TOTAL should be the same as SHORT_WAIT_TIME_TOTAL
C. Divide LONG_WAITS by LONG_WAIT_TIME_TOTAL and look for a small number.
D. Divide LONG_WAITS by IO_COUNT and look for a large number.
Answer: D
Explanation:
If the ratio of LONG_WAITS to IO_COUNT is large, then this file is likely a source of bottlenecks.
A, B, and C are incorrect, because all three of these calculations are not valid indicators of a
bottleneck.
Question: 63
Under what circumstances would you use transparent encryption for your RMAN backups?
(Choose the best answer.)
A. When youdont want to specify a password but share a wallet among several databases
B. When you can specify a password for a backup but can also use a wallet if you're on the same
database
C. When you want to restore the backup to the same database and you are using a wallet
D. When you want to send the backup to another site anddont want to use a password at the
remote site
Answer: C
Explanation:
Transparent encryption uses only an encryption wallet and cannot be used to recover to another
database.
A is incorrect because you cannot share wallets between databases.
B is incorrect because transparent encryption does not use passwords.
D is incorrect because you must use password encryption or no encryption at all to use a backup
at another site.
Question: 64
Which of the following initialization parameters are specific to an ASM instance? (Choose all that
apply.)
A. LARGE_POOL_SIZE
B. INSTANCE_TYPE
C. ASM_POWER_LIMIT
D. ASM_DISK_LIMITE ASM_DISKGROUPS
Answer: C
Explanation:
ASM_POWER_LIMIT throttles disk rebalance operations to make sure they don't interfere with
ongoing user I/O. ASM_DISKGROUPS specifies the disk groups that should automatically be
mounted when the ASM instance starts.
A is incorrect because LARGE_POOL_SIZE is used for both an ASM and an RDBMS instance.
B is incorrect because you use INSTANCE_TYPE to differentiate an instance between ASM and
RDBMS (RDBMS is the default).
D is incorrect because no ASM_DISK_LIMIT initialization parameter exists.
Question: 65
Which of the following clauses are valid for the FLASHBACK TABLE command? (Choose all that
apply.)
A. VERSIONS BETWEEN
B. AS OF
C. TO TIMESTAMP
D. TO BEFORE DROP
Answer: C,D
Explanation:
In addition to TO TIMESTAMP, you can also specify TO SCN to provide a point in time for table
recovery. If you use TO BEFORE DROP, you are actually using Flashback Drop but you still use
the FLASHBACK TABLE statement.
A is incorrect because VERSIONS BETWEEN is used for Flashback Versions Query.
B is incorrect because AS OF is used only for SELECT statements.
Question: 66
To recover from the loss of the entire database, including all current control files, all online redo
log files, and all parameter files, what backups are required, at a minimum, to restore the
database successfully? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Archived redo logs generated after the last datafile backups
B. One autobackup of the control file
C. One autobackup of the SPFILE
D. A backup of all datafiles
E. The password file
Answer: A,B,D
Explanation:
To recover your database fully, you need a backup of all datafiles , all archived log files created
since the last datafile backup, and an autobackup of the control file.
C and E are incorrect because you can easily re-create the password file, and RMAN creates a
dummy SPFILE during recovery.
Question: 67
You need to perform user-managed complete database recovery. What information do you need
to retrieve from VJRECOVERY_LOG? (Choose the best answer.)
A. The history of thedatafiles recovered so far
B. The archived redo log files required for recovery
C. Thedatafiles and archived redo log files required for recovery
D. The online redo log files that are corrupted and need to be re-created
Answer: B
Explanation:
For user-managed recovery, you need to query V$RECOVERY_LOG to identify the archived
redo log files needed for complete recovery, and V$RECOVERY_FILE to see which datafiles
need media recovery.
A is incorrect because V$RECOVERY_LOG is not a history of recovery operations.
C is incorrect because the view only contains a list of archived redo log files required for recovery.
D is incorrect because there is no dynamic performance view that identifies which online redo log
files are corrupt.
Question: 68
In RMAN, you execute the command CONFIGURE BACKUP OPTIMIZATION ON so that you
can avoid backing up objects that are already backed up sufficiently within the retention policy.
However, you want to make an additional backup of the USERS tablespace to a removable disk
for offsite storage. How can you ensure that RMAN does not skip the backup of the USERS
tablespace? (Choose the best answer.)
A. Turn backup optimization off, perform the backup, and then turn backup optimization back on.
B. Use the UNCONDITIONAL option: BACKUP UNCONDITIONAL TABLESPACE USERS;
C. Back up thetablespace to a different device type.
D. Use the FORCE option: BACKUP FORCE TABLESPACE USERS;.
Answer: D
Explanation:
D is correct. If you have backup optimization on, RMAN will unconditionally back up the object if
you use the FORCE option.
A is incorrect because this is not the best way to accomplish this task.
B is incorrect because no such RMAN keyword UNCONDITIONAL exists.
C is incorrect because the conditions for backup optimization may already be met on all device
types.

D. GRANT ADMINISTER_RESOURCE_MANAGER TO ANDREW WITH ADMIN OPTION;
Answer: C
Question: 79
You work as a Database Administrator for Federal Inc. The company uses an Oracle database.
You create backups and copies by using the operating system commands. Now, you want to use
Recovery Manager (RMAN) for backup and recovery operations. Moreover, you want to use a
recovery catalog as the RMAN repository. Which of the following steps will you take to
accomplish this? Each correct answer represents a part of the solution. Choose all that apply.
A. Execute the CATALOG command.
B. Reset the recovery catalog.
C. Register the database with the recovery catalog.
D. Create a recovery catalog.
Answer: A,C,D
Explanation:
Answer options D, C, and A are correct.
RMAN uses a central information repository called recovery catalog in order to store metadata
about backup and recovery operations. However, if a recovery catalog is not created, Recovery
Manager uses the target database's (the database that RMAN is backing up or restoring) control
file as the RMAN repository for storing the information necessary for backup and recovery
operations. In this scenario, after creating the recovery catalog, you will be required to register the
target database with the recovery catalog. The database must be registered with the recovery
catalog before the recovery catalog can store the metadata about backup and recovery
operations performed in the database. After registering the database , you will also be required to
execute the CATALOG command. The CATALOG command adds the information about the pre-
existing backups and copies to the recovery catalog.
B is incorrect. A recovery catalog needs to be reset in order to work with a database that has
been opened using the RESETLOGS option. However, in this scenario, you do not need to
reset the recovery catalog.

Question: 81
You work as a Database Administrator for your company. The company uses an Oracle database
named OraBase. You use Recovery Manager (RMAN) for backup and recovery operations. You
want to create a recovery catalog to store the metadata about the backup and recovery
operations. You create a database named CatalogBase in which you will store the recovery
catalog. You also create a database user account named CatOwner in the CatalogBase
database, which will hold the tables and views constituting the recovery catalog. What else will
you need to do in order to create the recovery catalog? Each correct answer represents a part of
the solution. Choose all that apply.
A. Connect to theCatalogBase database by using the CatOwner user account.
B. Grant the RECOVERY_CATALOG_OWNER pre-defined role to theCatOwner user account.
C. Grant the SYSDBA system privilege to theCatOwner user account.
D. Execute the CREATE CATALOG command.
Answer: A,B,D
Explanation:
Answer options B, A, and D are correct.
The RECOVERY_CATALOG_OWNER pre-defined role includes the privileges that allow the
catalog owner to maintain and query the recovery catalog. Therefore, you will be required to grant
the role to the CatOwner user account. After granting the role, you will be required to connect to
the CatalogBase database by using the CatOwner user account. After connecting to the
database, you can create the recovery catalog by executing the CREATE CATALOG command.
Answer option
C is incorrect. The SYSDBA system privilege is required for performing database administrative
tasks, such as creating a database, altering a database, and starting up and shutting down an
Oracle instance. You do not need to grant the SYSDBA system privilege to the CatOwner user
account, as this user account will not be used to administer the database. The CatOwner user
account will be used to only hold the catalog tables and views.
Question: 82
Which package provides API's for the SQL Tuning Advisor?
A. DBMS_MONITOR
B. DBMS_STATS
C. DBMS_SQLTUNE
D. DBMS_ADVISOR
Answer: C
Explanation:
Answer option C is correct.
The recommended interface for running the SQL Tuning Advisor is the Oracle Enterprise
Manager.
However, if Oracle Enterprise Manager is unavailable, you can run the SQL Tuning Advisor using
procedures in the DBMS_SQLTUNE package. The DBMS_SQLTUNE package provides the
following three interrelated areas of functionality:
? SQL Tuning Advisor Subprograms
? SQL Profile Subprograms
? SQL Tuning Set Subprograms
A is incorrect. The DBMS_MONITOR package lets you use PL/SQL for controlling additional
tracing and statistics gathering.
B is incorrect. With the DBMS_STATS package you can view and modify optimizer statistics
gathered for database objects. The Oracle RDBMS allows you to collect statistics of many
different kinds as an aid to improve performance. This package is concerned with optimizer
statistics only. Given that Oracle sets automatic statistics collection of this kind by default, this
package is intended for only specialized cases. The statistics of interest to be viewed or
modified can reside in the dictionary or in a table created in the user's schema for this
purpose. You can also collect and manage user-defined statistics for tables and domain
indexes using this package.
D is incorrect. DBMS_ADVISOR is part of the Server Manageability Suite of Advisors, a set of
expert systems that identifies and helps resolve performance problems relating to the various
database server components. Answer option
Question: 83
Which of the following file types are by default stored in the flash recovery area, if the files
have been defined? Each correct answer represents a complete solution. Choose all that apply.
A. Archiveredo log files
B. Database flashback logs
C. Undo data
D. Recovery Managerbackups
Answer: A,B,D
Explanation:
Answer options D, A, and B are correct.
The Flash Recovery Area is a specific location on disk that stores and manages files for back up
and recovery purposes. It is an automatic feature available in Oracle 10g and versions after.
Oracle-Managed Files (OMF) configures the Flash Recovery Area and utilizes the disk resources
managed by Automatic Storage Management (ASM). Recovery Manager (RMAN) performs the
task of automatic cleaning up. The Flash Recovery Area acts as a cache area for the back up
components that are to be copied to the tape. The Flash Recovery Area contains the following
database files:
? The control files
? The archive log files
? The flashback logs
? The control file and SPFILE auto-backups
? The datafile image copies
It is necessary to configure the Flash Recovery Area when a database is set up for the very first
time.
Question: 84
You work as a Database Administrator for your company. The company uses an Oracle
database. The database is set to run in ARCHIVELOG mode. You use Recovery Manager
(RMAN) for backup and recovery operations. You have specified two archive destinations, Disk1
and Disk2, for archival of redo logs. You want to back up the archived redo logs corresponding to
the log sequence numbers 43, 44, 45, and 46. After starting the backup operation, you find that
the archived redo logs corresponding to the log sequence number 44 and 45 are missing from
Disk1. Which of the following statements regarding the backup operation is true?
A. RMAN will back up only the archived redo log corresponding to the log sequence number 43.
B. RMAN will back up none of the archived redo logs.
C. RMAN will back up all the archived redo logs.
D. RMAN will back up the archived redo logs corresponding to the log sequence numbers 43 and
46.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Answer option C is correct.
In releases prior to Oracle9i, Recovery Manager (RMAN) only looked in the first archive
destination for archived redo logs when backing them up. However, in Oracle9i, RMAN can
perform archived redo log failover. In other words, RMAN can perform the following tasks:
? If at least one redo log corresponding to a given log sequence and thread number is availab
any of the archiving destinations, RMAN backs up the available redo log.
? If there is a corrupt block in a redo log that RMAN is accessing, RMAN searches other archive
destinations for a copy of the redo log without corrupt blocks. RMAN always backs up only one
copy out of the identical copies of each distinct archived redo log.
Question: 85
Your RMAN configuration has the backup optimization set to ON. Which of the following
commands will this setting affect? Each correct answer represents a complete solution. Choose
all that apply.
A. BACKUP ARCHIVELOG with ALL or LIKE options
B. BACKUP BACKUPSET ALL
C. BACKUP TABLESPACE
D. BACKUP DATABASE
Answer: A,B,D
Explanation:
Answer options D, A, and B are correct.
The CONFIGURE command is run to enable and disable backup optimization. Backup
optimization skips the backup of files in certain circumstances if the identical file or an identical
version of the file has already been backed up. Full details on the backup optimization algorithm
are provided in "backup optimization". Backup optimization applies only to the following
commands: BACKUP DATABASE BACKUP ARCHIVELOG with ALL or LIKE options BACKUP
BACKUPSET ALL By default, backup optimization is configured to OFF. To enable backup
optimization, run the following command: ONFIGURE BACKUP OPTIMIZATION ON; To disable
backup optimization, run the following command: ONFIGURE BACKUP OPTIMIZATION OFF;
To clear the current backup optimization setting, that is, return backup optimization to its default
etting, i.e . OFF, run the following command: ONFIGURE BACKUP OPTIMIZATION CLEAR;
nswer option
C is incorrect. The BACKUP TABLESPACE command will backup only the articular tablespace
data files and not the whole database. Thus, the optimization settings will not come in effect
for this backup.
Question: 86
Which of the following determines the location of the Automatic Diagnostic Repository (ADR)?
A. ADR_BASE directory
B. ADR_BASE environment variable
C. Flashback Recovery Area
D. DIAGNOSTIC_DEST instance parameter
Answer: D
Explanation:
Answer option D is correct. utomatic Diagnostic Repository (ADR) is a special central storage
point for all diagnostic reports. t is automatically maintained into memory by Oracle 11g. It
enables database components to apture diagnostic data at its first failure for critical errors. It is a
file base storage point. All nstances such as RDBMS and ASM instances maintain a separate
directory structures within DR. he DIAGNOSTIC_DEST instance parameter determines the
location of the Automatic iagnostic epository (ADR).
C, A, and B are incorrect. Flash Recovery Area is used to store backup and ecovery data, and
not problem diagnosis data. ADR_BASE is neither a directory nor an nvironment variable.
Question: 87
Which of the following helps the DBA to manage the tablespace as a single unit without taking
into account the structure and size of the underlying datafiles?
A. Temporarytablespace
B. SYSTEMtablespace
C. Transportabletablespace
D. Bigfile tablespace
E. SYSAUXtablespace
Answer: D
Explanation:
Answer option D is correct.
A bigfile tablespace is a new type of tablespace introduced in Oracle 10g. It is also available in
Oracle 11g. here can be only one file in a bigfile tablespace . The size of a bigfile tablespace file
can be a aximum of 128 TB (terabytes) for a 32K block tablespace and 32 TB for an 8K block
tablespace . dministrators must ensure that sufficient free disk space is available for a bigfile
tablespace file o that it can be expanded whenever required. For the same reason, Oracle
recommends that one make use of bigfile tablespace with Automatic Storage Management ASM),
Oracle Managed Files (OMF), logical volumes that are dynamically extensible, or a logical olume
manager that supports RAID. The biggest advantage of using a bigfile tablespace is that it s
capable of running file alteration operations with no file name specification. bigfile tablespace
must be created as locally managed, with automatic segment space anagement. This is the
default and hence need not be specified in the DDL statement CREATE IGFILE TABLESPACE.
On specifying either EXTENT MANAGEMENT DICTIONARY or EGMENT SPACE ANAGEMENT
MANUAL, Oracle will report an error. o create a bigfile tablespace named btbs of 80G, the llowing
DDL will be used: REATE BIGFILE TABLESPACE btbs ATAFILE '/or01/odata/orcl10g/btbs01.dbf'
IZE 80G ote: The SIZE can be specified in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), gigabytes (G), or
terabytes (T). o determine whether a tablespace is a bigfile or not, the administrator can query
any one of the following views: DBA_TABLESPACES USER_TABLESPACES V$TABLESPACE
These all comprise a column known as BIGFILE that stipulates whether a tablespace is a bigfile
or not.
Question: 88
You are creating an incident package to send to Oracle support as follows:
What kind of packaging are you using?
A. Metalink packaging
B. Custom packaging
C. Quick packaging
D. Detailed packaging
Answer: C
Explanation:
Answer option C is correct.
Quick packaging is easier to use, and makes sense when there is a need to send information on
a single problem to Oracle support immediately with default options. With custom packaging,
there is a bit more flexibility and the following things can be done: Edit the contents of the
package Remove or mask sensitive user data Generate and include additional dumps and test
cases
A is incorrect. There is no Metalink packaging; either a custom packaging or quick
packaging is used and the resulting package is always sent to Metalink for resolution.
B is incorrect
D is incorrect. There is no such packaging type called Detailed packaging.
Question: 89
DRAG DROP. Choose the logical components of an Oracle database and PLACE them in ASCENDING ORDER.
A. Data file
B. Control file
C. Segment
D. Data block
E. Redo log file
F. Extent
G. Tablespace
Answer: D,F,C,G
Explanation:
At the lowest level of granularity, Oracle stores data in data blocks. A data block is the smallest
logical unit of data storage in Oracle. It corresponds to a specific number of bytes of physical
database space. The size of a data block is specified by the DB_BLOCK_SIZE initialization
parameter at the time of database creation. It cannot be changed after database creation. The
size of a data block is usually a multiple of the operating system's block size. It can vary from 2KB
to 32KB, depending upon the operating system. If the size of a data block is not specified, by
default it is taken as 4KB on most operating systems. Oracle requests data in multiples of data
blocks. A data block is also called a logical block, Oracle block, or page. The next level of logical
database storage is an extent. An extent is a logical storage unit that contains data of a
corresponding segment. An extent consists of contiguous data blocks, and a segment is made up
of one or more extents. Whenever a segment is created, an initial extent is assigned to it, even
though the segment may be empty at the moment. When the extent corresponding to a segment
is full, a new extent is automatically allocated to the segment. When a segment is dropped, the
extents corresponding to the segment are again available for use by other segments. The level of
logical database storage above an extent is a segment. A segment is a set of extents allocated
for a specific database object such as a table, index, cluster etc. When a database object is
created, Oracle allocates a segment to it. This segment contains at least one extent that in turn
contains at least one data block. A single segment holds all the data of the corresponding
database object. A segment can belong to only one tablespace , but it can be associated to
multiple data files. Extents allocated to a segment can belong to multiple data files, but data
blocks allocated to an extent can belong to only one data file. The highest level of logical
database storage is a tablespace . A tablespace is a logical database structure for storing
database segments. By default, each Oracle database has a single tablespace , known as
SYSTEM, which stores data dictionary tables and indexes. Other tablespaces may also be
configured for a database for performing some specific tasks such as: ? Partial backup and
recovery operation ? Allocation of quotas for users Additional tablespaces can also be created as
per the requirements of the applications installed on the system. Such tablespaces can be used
for storing application specific segments. Data files, redo log files, and control files are the
physical, but not the logical components of an Oracle database contain at least one control file.
However, the recommended number of control files is two or more. A database can contain a
maximum of eight control files. However, a control file may belong to only one database.
Question: 90
You work as a Database Administrator for your company. The company uses an Oracle database
to retain its data. You have started an RMAN job. The job uses more than two channels, each
having a name. You are required to find out the names of all the channels being used by that job.
The V$SESSION dynamic performance view contains the details of every current session. Which
of the following columns of the V$SESSION dynamic performance view will you enquire to find
out the names of the channels?
A. SERIAL#
B. CLIENT_INFO
C. CHANNEL_INFO
D. MODULE
Answer: B
Explanation:
Answer option B is correct.
The CLIENT_INFO column of the V$SESSION dynamic performance view stores information
related to the client application of the user session. The column contains the string rman along
with the name of the channel. If the information is more than 64 bytes, it gets truncated. The
information is set and registered by the SET_CLIENT_INFO procedure of the
DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO package. The following query will give the required output:
SELECT CLIENT_INFO FROM V$SESSION WHERE CLIENT_INFO LIKE '% rman %';
CLIENT_INFO ----------------------- rman channel=c1 rman channel=c2 2 rows selected
A is incorrect. The SERIAL# column of the V$SESSION dynamic performance view
stores the serial number of the session. The serial number of a session is used to distinctively
identify the objects of the particular session. It is the work of this column to assure that the
session-level commands are in accordance with the appropriate objects of the session when
the
new session is given the session ID of the older one that has already ended.
D is incorrect. The MODULE column of the V$SESSION dynamic performance
view stores the name of the module that is in execution currently. The name of the module is
set when the SET_MODULE procedure of the DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO package is called.
The DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO package helps simplify session activity tracking by enabling
the programs to insert information to the V$SESSION and V$SESSION_LONGOPS views.
The program, once initiated, gets itself registered via the SET_MODULE procedure of the
DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO package .
C is incorrect. There is no such column as CHANNEL_INFO in the V$SESSION dynamic
performance view.
Question: 91
You work as a Database Administrator for your company. The company uses Oracle as its
database. The manager of the company wants you to move the company's databases to another
server, as the performance of the old server is now degraded. Which of the following RMAN
commands will you use to accomplish the task?
A. DUPLICATE
B. CONVERT
C. CONNECT
D. REGISTER
Answer: A
Explanation:
Answer option A is correct.
The RMAN's DUPLICATE command uses backups of the target database to create a duplicate
database that can be used for testing purposes or to create a standby database. The command is
also used to move the database to a new server. In order to move a database from one location
to another, user-managed incomplete recovery options such as utilizing the backup control file in
conjunction with the RECOVER DATABASE USING BACKUP CONTROLFILE UNTIL CANCEL
command can be used.
B is incorrect. The CONVERT command is used to convert data file formats to
transport tablespaces across various platforms.
C is incorrect. The CONNECT command is used to establish a connection between
RMAN and a target, auxiliary, or recovery catalog database.
D is incorrect. The REGISTER command is used to register the target database in
the recovery catalog.
Question: 92
Martha is an employee in Tech-Mart Inc. The company uses an Oracle database. The database
contains a table named Employees for storing employee records. Martha is performing an insert
operation on the Employees table. After some time, the insert operation fails. Which of the
following types of failures has occurred?
A. Media failure
B. Instance failure
C. Statement failure
D. Process failure
Answer: C
Explanation:
Answer option C is correct.
A statement failure occurs when there is a logical failure in the handling of a statement in an
Oracle program. For example, when all extents of a table (in other words, the number of extents
specified in the MAXEXTENTS parameter of the CREATE TABLE statement) are allocated and
completely filled with data, a valid INSERT statement cannot insert a row because no space is
available. Therefore, the statement fails.If a statement failure occurs, the Oracle software or
operating system returns an error. A statement failure does not require any recovery step. Oracle
automatically resolves the statement failure by rolling back the effects of the statement and
returning control to the application. The user can execute the statement again after the problem
indicated by the error message is corrected. For example, if insufficient extents are allocated, the
database administrator (DBA) needs to allocate more extents so that the user's statement can be
executed.
A is incorrect. A media failure occurs when a physical problem prevents Oracle from writing or
reading a database file that is required for continuing the database operation. For example,
when a disk head crashes, all the database files on the disk drive are lost. Disk failure can
affect a variety of files, including the data files, redo log files, and control files. Because the
database instance cannot continue to function properly, it cannot write the data from the
database buffer cache of the system global area (SGA) to the data files. The appropriate
recovery from a media failure depends on the files affected. Media failure is the primary
concern of a backup and recovery strategy because it typically requires restoring some or all
the database files and the application of redo data during the recovery.
B is incorrect. An instance failure is a termination of an Oracle instance due to a hardware
problem (e.g., power outage) or software problem (e.g., an operating system crash) that
prevents the Oracle instance from continuing its work. An instance failure always occurs when
a database is not cleanly shut down (i.e., the database is shut down using the SHUTDOWN
ABORT command). When an instance failure occurs, the data in the database buffer cache is
not written to data files. Therefore, after an instance failure, the associated database requires
instance recovery to recover the lost data. After an instance failure, Oracle automatically
performs an instance recovery when the instance is restarted. The system monitor (SMON)
background process is responsible for performing the instance recovery. An instance recovery
does not require any manual interference. Oracle automatically applies the data stored in
online redo log files and undo segments in order to recover the lost data and roll back the
uncommitted transactions, respectively.
D is incorrect. A process failure is a failure in a user, server, or background process of an Oracle
instance such as an abnormal disconnection or process termination. When a process failure
occurs, the failed subordinate process cannot continue its work, although the other processes
of the Oracle instance can continue. The process monitor (PMON) background process
detects aborted user, server, or background processes. If the aborted process is a user or
server process, PMON automatically resolves the failure by rolling back the current transaction
of the aborted process and releasing the resources that this process was using. However, if
the aborted process is a background process, the Oracle instance cannot continue to function
properly. Therefore, the Oracle instance must be shut down and re-started in order to resolve
the issue.
Question: 93
Which of the following advisors within the Oracle advisory framework will analyze a single SQL
statement and make recommendations for performance improvement?
A. SQL Repair Advisor
B. SQL Optimizer
C. SQL Access Advisor
D. SQL Tuning Advisor
Answer: D
Explanation:
Answer option D is correct.
The SQL Tuning Advisor takes one or more SQL statements and performs an analysis to
determine what can be done to improve the performance of the SQL statement(s).
Recommendations include rewriting the SQL statement, adding indexes, or even changing
initialization parameters or memory component sizes such as the SGA size or buffer cache. The
SQL Tuning Advisor is accessed via tools such as Top SQL, the Automatic SQL Tuning Advisor,
or the Top Sessions interface from within EM. In contrast, the SQL Access Advisor takes a
broader view of SQL tuning. It considers a larger subset of SQL statements, such as all SQL
statements run within a specified time period or from a SQL Tuning Set (STS). The SQL Access
advisor may recommend additional indexes as well as materialized views to improve
performance. The SQL Repair Advisor analyzes a SQL statement that causes a critical error and
records the results in the Automatic Diagnostic Repository (ADR). It may recommend a patch to
fix the problem, or may provide an alternate execution plan to avoid causing an error in the future.
Other advisors within the advisory framework include memory advisors that monitor usage of the
SGA and PGA and recommend optimal settings for these memory structures including the
substructures within them, such as the library cache and the large pool.
A is incorrect. The SQL Repair Advisor only makes recommendations for SQL statements that
cause a critical error in the ADR.
B is incorrect. There is no such advisor such as the SQL Optimizer, although the Oracle optimizer
uses statistics to determine the best execution plan.
C is incorrect. The SQL Access Advisor analyzes groups of SQL statements that run during the
same time period, not one or two SQL statements in isolation as the SQL Tuning Advisor does
.
Question: 94
Brenda works as a Database Administrator for your company. The company uses an Oracle
database. Brenda wants to specify a number of locations to which the redo logs should be
archived before an error occurs. Which of the following initialization parameters will she use to
accomplish this?
A. LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_STATE_n
B. LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_n
C. LOG_ARCHIVE_DUPLEX_DEST
D. LOG_ARCHIVE_MIN_SUCCEED_DEST
Answer: D
Explanation:
Answer option D is correct.
The LOG_ARCHIVE_MIN_SUCCEED_DEST initialization parameter is used along with the
LOG_ARCHIVE_DUPLEX_DEST and LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_n parameters. This parameter
specifies the number of archive destinations to which the redo logs must be written before an
error occurs.
A is incorrect. The LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_STATE_n parameter specifies whether or not the
archive destination accepts writing of redo logs. This parameter takes on three values,
ENABLE, DEFER, and ALTERNATE. The value ENABLE indicates that redo logs can be
written to the archive destination. The value DEFER indicates that the archive destination is
temporarily disabled. The value ALTERNATE indicates that the archive destination is an
alternative that can accept writing of redo logs to the archive destination only when its parent
destination fails. This parameter is used along with the LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_n parameter.
B is incorrect. The LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_n parameter specifies multiple archive destinations.
C is incorrect. The LOG_ARCHIVE_DUPLEX_DEST parameter specifies that the redo logs be
written to both the archive destinations.
Question: 95
Which of the following statements about conventional tablespaces (non-locally managed
tablespaces) are true? Each correct answer represents a part of the solution. Choose two
A. Conventionaltablespaces use data dictionary tables for storage space management.
B. Conventionaltablespaces use bitmaps for storage space management.
C. In case of conventionaltablespaces, Oracle reflects the allocation of a new extent by updating
th associated segment header and the data dictionary table.
D. In case of conventionaltablespaces, Oracle reflects the allocation of a new extent by updating
th associated segment header and the bitmap.
Answer: A,C
Explanation:
Answer options A and C are correct. In case of conventional tablespaces (the approach of
Oracle7i and below), Oracle uses data dictionary tables to manage storage space. When a new
extent is allocated to a segment under a conventional tablespace , its allocation is reflected by
updating the corresponding segment header and the associated data dictionary tables.
B and D are incorrect. In case of a locally managed tablespace , Oracle uses a
bitmap for managing the storage space.
Question: 96
Which of the following statements about a recovery catalog are true? Each correct answer
represents a complete solution. Choose two.
A. Recovery catalog should not be created in the target database.
B. The information in the recovery catalog is obtained from the target database's control file.
C. In case of multiple target databases, a recovery catalog schema must be created for each
target database.
D. Recovery Manager (RMAN) must have a recovery catalog for its normal functioning.
Answer: A,B
Explanation:
Answer options A and B are correct.
A recovery catalog is a set of tables and views that Recovery Manager (RMAN) uses to store
metadata (information about a database structure, archived redo logs, backup sets, and data file
copies) about a target database (database that RMAN backups or restores). RMAN uses this
metadata to conduct its backup, recovery, and maintenance operations. Recovery catalog is
optional, i.e., if a recovery catalog is not created, RMAN uses the target database's control file to
store the metadata about the target database. Although RMAN can conduct all major backup and
recovery operations by using the control file, some RMAN commands work only if a recovery
catalog exists. A recovery catalog is solely managed by RMAN. RMAN propagates information
about the database structure, archived redo logs, backup sets, and data file copies into the
recovery catalog from the target database's control file. A recovery catalog can be used to store
metadata about multiple target databases. The tables and views constituting a recovery catalog
are owned by a recovery catalog schema. Oracle recommends creating a recovery catalog
schema in a separate dedicated database and not in the target database. A database containing
a recovery catalog schema is called a recovery catalog database. C is incorrect. A single
recovery catalog schema can store metadata about any number of target databases.
Question: 97
Which of the following Dynamic Performance views contain information relevant to SQL Tuning?
Each correct answer represents a part of the solution. Choose all that apply..
A. V$SQLSTATS
B. V$SQLAREA
C. V$SQL_BIND_DATA
D. V$SQL
Answer: A,B,C,D
Explanation:
Answer options D, B, A and C are correct. Dynamic views containing information relevant to the
SQL tuning are V$SQL, V$SQLAREA, V$SQLSTATS, and V$SQL_BIND_DATA. V$SQL lists
statistics on shared SQL area without the GROUP BY clause and contains one row for each child
of the original SQL text entered. Statistics displayed in V$SQL are normally updated at the end of
query execution. However, for long running queries, they are updated every 5 seconds. This
makes it easy to see the impact of long running SQL statements while they are still in progress .
V$SQLAREA lists statistics on shared SQL area and contains one row per SQL string. It provides
statistics on SQL statements that are in memory, parsed, and ready for execution. V$SQLSTATS
returns basic performance statistics for SQL cursors, with each row representingthe data for a
unique combination of SQL text and optimizer plan (that is, unique combination of SQL_ID, and
PLAN_HASH_VALUE). The column definitions for columns in V$SQLSTATS are identical to
those in the V$SQL and V$SQLAREA views. However, the V$SQLSTATS view differs from
V$SQL and V$SQLAREA in that it is faster, more scalable, and has a greater data retention
(the statistics may still appear in this view, even after the cursor has been aged out of the shared
pool). Note that V$SQLSTATS contains a subset of columns that appear in V$SQL and
V$SQLAREA. For each distinct bind variable in each cursor owned by the session querying the
V$SQL_BIND_DATA view, this view describes: Actual bind data, if the bind variable is user
defined The underlying literal, if the CURSOR_SHARING parameter is set to FORCE and the
bind variable is system.
Question: 98
You work as a Database Administrator for Gentech Inc. The company uses an Oracle database.
You use Recovery Manager (RMAN) for backup and recovery operations. You do not perform a
regular backup of the database. You want to implement a backup retention policy for the backups
and copies that you create with RMAN. Through the retention policy, you want to ensure that one
backup of each data file is retained for at least five days. Which of the following RMAN
commands will you use to accomplish this?
A. CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY TO NONE;
B. CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY TO RECOVERY WINDOW OF 5 DAYS;
C. CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY TO REDUNDANCY 5;
D. CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY CLEAR;
Answer: B
Explanation:
Answer option B is correct.
The Recovery Manager (RMAN) provides the CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY command to
create a persistent and automatic backup retention policy for controlling how long backups and
copies should be retained. When a backup retention policy is in effect, RMAN considers the
backups and copies of data files and control files as obsolete (i.e., the backups and copies are no
longer needed for media recovery), according to the criteria specified in the CONFIGURE
RETENTION POLICY command. The REPORT OBSOLETE and DELETE OBSOLETE
commands can be executed periodically or regularly to view obsolete files and to delete them,
respectively. The retention policy is continuous. As the data file, control file, and archived redo log
backups are produced over time, RMAN keeps track of them and decides which to retain and
which to mark as obsolete. RMAN does not automatically delete the backups or copies. The term
obsolete does not mean the same as expired. A backup or copy is obsolete when the REPORT
OBSOLETE or DELETE OBSOLETE command determines, based on the user-defined retention
policy, that the backup or copy is not needed for media recovery. However, a backup or copy
expires only when RMAN performs a crosscheck and finds that the file is missing from the hard
disk or the media manager has returned "not found" for the file. In brief, obsolete means "not
needed," whereas expired means "not found." Besides affecting the data file and control file
backups, the retention policy affects archived redo logs and archived redo log backups. First,
RMAN decides which data file and control file backups are obsolete. Then, RMAN considers the
archived redo log backups (that are older than the oldest data file or control file backup that must
be retained) as obsolete. There are two mutually exclusive options for implementing a backup
retention policy.
Question: 99
Which of the following types of failures is the cause of automatic Instance Recovery?
A. User error
B. Instance failure
C. Process failure
D. Media failure
Answer: B
Explanation:
Answer option B is correct. Instance failure occurs when any problem prevents an instance from
continuing work. Instance failure can result from hardware problem such as a power outage, or
software problem such as an operating system failure. When an instance failure occurs, the data
in the buffers of the system global area is not written to the data files. After an instance failure,
Oracle automatically performs instance recovery.
A is incorrect. User error requires a database to be recovered to a point in time before the error
occurred. For example, a user could accidentally drop a table. To enable recovery from user
errors and accommodate other unique recovery requirements, Oracle provides exact point-in-
time recovery. For example, if a user accidentally drops a table, the database can be
recovered to the instant in time before the table was dropped.
C is incorrect. Process failure results from a failure in a user process accessing Oracle, such as
an abnormal disconnection or process termination. The background process PMON
automatically detects the failed user process, rolls back the uncommitted transaction of the
user process, and releases any resources that the process was using.
D is incorrect. An error can occur when trying to write or read a file on disk that is required to
operate the database. A common example is a disk head failure, which causes the loss of all
files on a disk drive. A disk failure requires you to restore lost files and then perform media
recovery. Unlike instance recovery, media recovery must be initiated by the user.
Question: 100
Which of the following advisors is run in every maintenance window by the auto-task system?
A. The Memory Advisor
B. The SQL Tuning Advisor
C. The Undo Advisor
D. The SQL Access Advisor
Answer: D
Explanation:
Answer option D is correct. The SQL Access Advisor is an ADDM diagnostic advisor that
provides additional support to find out the potential schema modifications. These potential
schema modifications can be used to reduce the amount of I/O, CPU, and wait time for a given
SQL statement. The advisor also makes potential suggestions about indexes and materialized
views to improve the system performance. The SQL Access Advisor and the Segment Advisor
run in every maintenance window by the autotask system. However, implementing the
recommendations is up to a DBA.
A is incorrect. The Memory Advisor is used to collect information about Oracle's memory
structures inclusive of the System Global Area (SGA) and user memory structures.
B is incorrect. The SQL Tuning Advisor is an ADDM diagnostic advisor that formulates more
efficient SQL execution plans for a particular SQL statement. The advisor accepts a SQL
statement as input and gives the advice on the execution of the SQL statement, the estimated
performance benefit, and the actual command in order to improve its efficiency.
C is incorrect. The Undo Advisor is an ADDM diagnostic advisor that is used to determine
appropriate sizing for Undo tablespaces and also helps in determining optimal
UNDO_RETENTION settings. This advisor helps prevent the snapshot too old error. It also
sets a threshold value for undo retention period, helps find out the issues related to the undo
tablespace and provides recommendations to correct these issues.
Question: 101
Which of the following are segment types in a database? Each correct answer represents a
complete solution. Choose all that apply.
A. Data
B. Index
C. Schema
D. Undo
Answer: A,B,D
Explanation:
Answer options D, A, and B are correct. The four types of segments in a database are as follows :
1. Data segment
2. Index segment
3. Undo segment
4. Temporary segment.
Each non-cluster, non-IOT table has a data segment. Indexes are stored in index segments.
Undo segments are stored in an UNDO tablespace , and contains information needed for
readconsistency and to roll back transactions. Temporary segments are stored in a temporary
tablespace and are used when there is not enough room in memory to perform a SQL
statement's sorting operation.
C is incorrect. A schema is the entire collection of objects owned by a database user. A schema
object can be a table, view, index, cluster, synonym, etc. Schema objects are at a much higher
logical level than segments, although indexes are stored in index segments and tables are
stored in data segments. Reference: Oracle Database 11g: Administration Workshop I

Question: 102
Which of the following statements about Automatic Storage Management are true? Each correct
answer represents a complete solution. Choose all that apply.
A. It is designed to release the burden of disk and storage management.
B. It is a simple storage management interface available to the Database Administrator.
C. It provides various tools that can save the time of the Database Administrator.
D. It is inconsistent across the server and storage platforms.
E. It manages many data files individually.
Answer: A,B,C
Explanation:
Answer options B, C, and A are correct. Automated storage management (ASM) is a new storage
mechanism available in Oracle 10g or in newer version. ASM is a simple storage management
interface available to the DBA. ASM is consistent across the server and storage platforms. It
provides beneficial tools to the DBA to create and manage a robust, flexible, and scalable file
storage system, ready for access by any existing Oracle database instance. ASM provides
various tools that can save the DBA's time and flexibility to manage a dynamic database
environment with increased efficiency. ASM is designed to release the burden of disk and storage
management, and depends on Oracle to maintain database storage. Instead of managing many
data files individually, ASM creates disk groups for file management. Therefore, a disk group can
be defined as a logical unit that Oracle views as a single unit of storage. This is very much akin to
various flavors of Unix defining volume groups. Oracle manages storage definitions of a database
in a second database used exclusively by ASM to keep track of disk group allocations. While
creating a database, if the AS M option is selected at the storage option window, then guidance
about the process of defining the secondary ASM database instance is provided via a series of
windows. ASM also employs a unique naming convention based on Oracle Flexible architecture
(OFA). Reference: http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/asm/index.html
Question: 103
You work as a Database Administrator for Bell Ceramics Inc. The Manager of the company asks
you to run a job at some specified point in time, say at 5:00 PM every day. Which of the following
stored database objects will you use to accomplish the task?
A. Job
B. Program
C. Schedule
D. Window
Answer: C
Explanation:
Answer option C is correct. To run a job every day at 5:00 PM , you should use a schedule. By
using the DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_SCHEDULE procedure, you can create the schedule.
Note: No special privilege is needed to create a schedule. Schedules can be created with access
to the PUBLIC role. To schedule a job, follow the PL/SQL block given below: BEGIN
DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_SCHEDULE ( schedule _name => 'eve_at_5_schedule',
start_date => SYSTIMESTAMP, end_date => SYSTIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '30' day,
repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY; BYHOUR=17', comments => 'Runs every evening');
END; his will create a schedule named eve_at_5_schedule for a job. The start date of the job is
the ystem date and time. The end date of the job is specified by the interval, i.e., system date and
time plus 30 days. he repeat interval is specified by some parameters, such as FREQ used in the
mentioned xample. The FREQ parameter defines the frequency type. The various values for the
REQ arameter are as follows:
? YEARLY
? WEEKLY
? MONTHLY
? DAILY
? HOURLY
? MINUTELY
? SECONDLY
The BYHOUR element specifies the hour at which the job is required to run. The valid values for
this element are 0-23. scheduler is defined as a stored database object that specifies a schedule
for a job or for a indow. chedules can be shared among users by creating and saving them as
objects in the database. It lso specifies how often a job will be repeated. ote: The repeat interval
can be specified in either of the following ways: By using the PL/SQL expressions. ? By using the
calendaring syntax, which is new to Oracle 10g. Answer option A is incorrect. A job is defined as
the most-basic self-contained object in a scheduler environment. It specifies the action to perform
and the time at which to perform it. In technical terms, a job is a part of a structure consisting of a
number of scheduler objects of various types. It automates standard and repetitive tasks.
A job can be categorized into the following entities:
? A single SQL statement
? A PL /SQL block
? A PL /SQL stored procedure
? A java stored procedure
? Any executable file stored in the server file system, either a binary executable or a shell script
In other words, a job is a combination of a schedule and a program with any additional arguments
that a program requires. Answer option B is incorrect. A program is defined as a combination of
several code lines that are run to accomplish a particular task. It contains parameters, which can
be passed at runtime of the program. It can be stored in a database as an independent object
and is shared by many jobs. Answer option D is incorrect. A window is defined as one of the
stored database objects. A window automatically activates different resource plans at different
times. If there has been a change in the resource plan, then all the running jobs can see the
changes in the resource plans. A window includes the following attributes:
? Schedule: It specifies when to open a window.
? Duration: It specifies how long a window will remain open.
? Resource plan: It specifies the name of the resource plan activated.
Note: Windows are created in the SYS schema. Many windows can be created in the SYS
schema, but only one of them is effective at a time.

You work as a Database Administrator for Blue-Well Inc. The company uses an Oracle
database. The database contains a resource consumer group named QUERY_USERS. You want
to specify the maximum number of active sessions allowed in the QUERY_USERS resource
consumer group as twenty. Which of the following Database Resource Manager parameters will
you use to accomplish this?
A. ACTIVE_SESSION_QUEUE
B. PARALLEL_DEGREE_LIMIT
C. ACTIVE_SESS_POOL_P1
D. ACTIVE_SESS_P1
Answer: C
Explanation:
Answer option C is correct. The ACTIVE_SESS_POOL_P1 parameter is used to specify the
maximum number of active sessions that are allowed in a resource consumer group.
D and A are incorrect. There is no such parameter as ACTIVE_SESS_P1 or
ACTIVE_SESSION_QUEUE in Oracle
B is incorrect. The PARALLEL_DEGREE_LIMIT parameter specifies the degree of
parallelism allowed for a query.

A. archived redo logs generated after the last datafile backups
B. one autobackup of the control file
C. one autobackup of the spfile
D. a backup of all datafiles i e the password file
Answer: A, B, D
Explanation:
To recover your database fully, you need a backup of all datafiles, all archived log files created
since the last datafile backup, and an autobackup of the control file. c and e are incorrect
because you can easily re-create the password file, and rman creates a dummy spfile during
recovery.
